# Zequencer Update for SARS2-COVID-19
- Zequencer is a variant calling pipeline that has been optimized for Illumina's MiSeq generated reads
- It assumes: 
    - The reads are that high quality, high accuracy as expected with a properly calibrated MiSeq platform.
    - Input files are in the fastq.gz format 
    - Input files use the were generated with the artic ncov-2019 v3 primers.
    - more information is located at https://artic.network/ncov-2019 
    - File names are of the naming format SAMPLE_NAME-R1.fastq.gz and SAMPLE_NAME-R2.fastq.gz
        - Where R1 is the has one set of reads, and R2 has the matching reverse paired reads.
    - headers are in the miseq nomenclature:
        - example @M01472:366:000000000-JDJFD:1:1101:14487:2478 2:N:0:15 matches to: 
        @M01472:366:000000000-JDJFD:1:1101:14487:2478 1:N:0:15
- Additional Files needed for each run:
     - bed file that gives the start and end location of each primer agains the reference sequence
     - reference sequence fasta of the full genome (reference genome fasta that the bed file mapped)
     - snpEff configuration files that was build with snpEff build
 
 ## Considerations for using this version of Zequencer
- Zequencer has been modified over the years.
- The pipeline one uses is specific to the primers set.
- Considerations to modifying the pipeline include:
    - Are one or more of the primer multiplexed and amplify differently in the overlapping region?
        - The primers are based on the SARS-COV2 - MN908947.3 strain. Some primers have alternates that are offset with the goal of increasing the amplification in that part of the genome
        - The after trimming, consecutive amplicons overlap by 20-60 bp's (see bed file)
    - Are all primers the same length?
        - This workflow assumes the primers are not all the same length. It attempts to trim only the primer region instead of just trimming a set bp from each side.
    - Are the forward primers paired with a specific reverse primer?
        - This worflow assumes the use of forward and reverse primers.  Additionally, each amplicon should map to one location in the genome.
        - If there is recombination, this pipeline may not be able to identify the recombination. The reads are mapped and filtered using the reference genome or expected amplicon regions of the genome
        - A pipeline that specializes in recombination (and possibly a different primer system )
    - Are there alternates in the primers (offset by a few base pairs)?
        - This primer system has alternates that are offset by a few base pairs.  
        - When set to strict_adaptors, the forward and reverse primers much be a perfect match and occur on opposites ends of the reads.
            -  Alternate primers are allowed to be considered a match regaurdless if the reverse primer is alternate.
    - Do primers in the same (or about the same) locations have different sequences meant to amplify different variants?
        - The primers are not multiplexed to pick up variants.  If the downsampling is set to a positive number (200 or 2000 recommended) downsampling normalization can still be done 
    - Do primers map to multiple locations in the genome?
        - The primers do not map to multiple locations in the genome.  
        - This version merges the forward and reverse reads and requires a miniumum overlap of 12 BP to be considered a valid read.  
        - As stated before reads resulting from recombination will likely be removed and not called as variants.  
        - This merge step may make it difficult to find recombination, but it this helps remove PCR Chimera's or other PCR errors, where recombination happens during the PCR process
- Not all pipelines work for all situations.  Do not blindly apply this pipeline to another primer/adapter system. 
   
     
# Arguments
- Defaults are based on the docker deployed version.
- Bed path, ref_adaptor_path, ref_path and config_path should be changed as needed.
- Many of these settings directly change the arguments of the BBMAP suite of tools
- Setting strict_adaptors to TRUE will use a custom script to locate the primers, ensure they are a perfect match, a matching reverse paired end, occur on the ends, and trim the primers.

## Method 2 docker:
This has not been tested with docker on a Windows platform.
This pipeline has been successfully tested on the following operating systems:
MacOSX 10.14 with some packages installed with homebrew.

Download the directory zequencer_docker from github.
Decompress the directory as needed, and change to the directory you downloaded.
example if downloaded to you home directory ~/:
```bash
cd ~/zequencer_docker
# zequencer_ncov:v1 can be changed to a different tag as needed
docker build -t zequencer_ncov:v1 .
# run docker image (this uses in interactive mode, but interactive mode is not required), 
# mounted volumes with -v can be changed as needed
# cpus can be changed as needed
docker run --cpus 4 -it -v /Volumes:/Volumes -v /Users:/Users zequencer_ncov:v1

```
# Example usage:
- Volumes have been mounted using the above Docker code
- In this example, the sample_dir is "/Volumes/T7/zequencer/south_africa/samples"
- Change this path to reflect your sample directory of paired fastq.gz files
- The paired files must have nomenclature of: SAMPLE_NAME-R1.fastq.gz and SAMPLE_NAME-R2.fastq.gz
- I am using the default relative path (that is created if it does not exist of ../out )
    - Which for this case is: /Volumes/T7/zequencer/south_africa/out
```bash
# downsample to 2000 reads per amplicon, 
# when calling variants use: allele fraction of 0.01 
# and use BBDUK

# About fast_normalize downsampling normalization
- The existing nomalization was developed by Dr. Nick Loman, Professor of Microbial Genomics and Bioinformatics at  University of Birmingham, and adapted by Dr. David O'Connors lab (fast_normalize = false) maps each read to each primer (all 196+)
    - Then it will only retain up to the amount defined in reads_per_adaptor per each mapped primer
    - Example: 
        - if reads_per_adaptor=2000, and 6000 reads map to primer one and 1500 reads to primer 2,
        - only 2000 of the 6000 reads will be retained for primer one and all 1500 reads mapping to primer 2. 2.
    - This is particularly useful if you have variants the only map to one primer set that is overlapping with another primer set.
- The fast_normalize method also downsamples, but does only one mapping step (instead of one per primer), and uses the position the start position of the mapped read to the reference and the positions of the primers in the bed file
    - This uses a custom python script and pysam to conduct the filtering.
    - This has been shown to be upto 100x faster than the other downsampling method
    - This mimics the algorithm used in Nexstrain's Minion step for ONT downsampling.
    - The main advantage is speed, however if a future primer set is developed with primers that are specialized to find variants, this technique is not adequate for downsampling.
    - Generally downsampling is optional, as the primer sets use the same reference sequence and is more to try to get a more accurate percentage for a variant in the case of one primer in an overlapping region doing better to amplify reads than another primer.
# Trouble shooting:
- set rem_int_files to false (--rem_int_files f) to keep the intermediate files generated by the pipeline.  This will require about 5-10x more hardrive space but may help figure out issues
- During testing docker has randomly lost the ability to use relative paths because cwd or pwd failed on the  mounted Volumes.  
    - You will see this as a "pwd cannot find ." or "os.getcwd()" error. 
    - using the command "pw"d will result in an error in bash.
    - Exiting and rerunning the docker image and/or restarting docker resolved this issue  during testing
